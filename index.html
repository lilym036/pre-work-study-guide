        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements.</li>
          <li>In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage.</li>
          <li>The best practice is to use semantic elements whenever possible, especially when the content is visible to users.
          </li>
          <li>When working with visible HTML elements, the content is contained between an opening tag and a closing tag.

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS is the programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users.</li>
          <li>Whereas HTML strictly handles the structure and content of a webpage, CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization.</li>
          <li>CSS is used to define style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them using a wide range of style options.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS. They're useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets.</li>
          <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. It allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>Rather than repeating a rule which would add more lines of code and repetition, two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>One of JavaScript's core features is variables. It is an object-oriented programming language.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>A semicolon at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends.</li>
          <li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result.</li>
          <lil>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</lil>
          <li>A single array can store different types of data, such as strings, numbers, and so on.</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>A function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task. A function does not automatically execute when the JavaScript file is run but instead needs to be called by name in order to execute it.</li>
          <li>A function's name is followed by parentheses.</li>
